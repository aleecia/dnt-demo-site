Do-Not-Track demo site
-----------------------------------------------
SUMMARY: This site tracks users (every time the "tracking" image is encountered
on other parties' web sites), and when they arrive at this page, it shows them
where they've been.  This demo has a cookie-based Opt-Out system, but also
honors the "DNT: 1" header as an equivalent "don't track me" option.

DEVELOPER: Sid Stamm <sid@mozilla.com>

NOTES:
* When installing, be sure to copy the config/config.default.php to
